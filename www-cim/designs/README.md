Important files in this directory for using Timeloop for evaluation of different CiM architectures:

Architecture files (Variables defined in each file, which are modified later)
0. tensor-core-like: arch_split.yaml (Architecture inspired from the timeloop-accelergy examples, with RF size changed to 4KB.)
1. rf_compute: arch_split.yaml
2. smem_compute: arch_split.yaml
3. example: arch files for experimental purposes

Component file for cim: _components/cimmac.yaml

Problem file: _include/mm-example.yaml
